# Personal MineSweeper Implementation
Here, I have implemented the famous MineSweeper game using my knowledge of C programming.

This is a single-player game, where you must uncover the squares of the board without stepping (i.e. selecting) a mine.
------------------------
This was my second game implementation, and the most complex to date, with the main challenges being the implementation of
1.
An appropriate grid

2.
The hidden square discovery method which reveals a set of squares (without mines) adjacent to the selected square, each revealed square displaying the number of mines adjacent to it.

The most dramatic bit, which is the revealing of all the hidden mines if you step on one (and hence lose the game), was also the easiest bit, although it was very satisfying to see.
